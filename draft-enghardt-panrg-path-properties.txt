1.  Introduction

   Because the current Internet provides a best-effort bit pipe,
   endpoints do not know much about the path to other endpoints.  A Path
   Aware Network exposes information about one or multiple paths through
   the network to endpoints, so that endpoints can use this information.

   Such path properties may be relatively static, e.g., the nature of
   the access technology on the first hop, or relatively dynamic, e.g.,
   current Round Trip Time.

   This document addresses the first of the questions in Path-Aware
   Networking [I-D.irtf-panrg-questions], which is a product of the
   PANRG in the IRTF.

2.  Static Properties

   Static Path Properties are not expected to change very often: they
   stay constant within the lifetime of a connection to another
   endpoint.  They usually relate to the access network within the first
   hop or the first few hops.

   Access Technology present on the path:  The lower layer technology on
      the first hop, for example, WiFi, Wired Ethernet, or Cellular.
      This can also be more detailed, e.g., further specifying the
      Cellular as 2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G technology, or the WiFi as 802.11a,
      b, g, n, or ac.  These are just examples, this list is not
      exhaustive, and there is no common index of identifiers here.
      Note that access technologies further along the path may also be
      relevant, e.g., a cellular backbone is not only the first hop, and
      there may be a DSL line behind the WiFi.

   Monetary Cost:  This is information related to billing, data caps,
      etc.  It could be the allowed monthly data cap, the start and end

      of a billing period, the monetary cost per Megabyte sent or
      received, etc.

3.  Topology Properties

   [FIXME: Can we come up with a better name?]

   Topology Properties can change within the lifetime of a connection to
   a another endpoint, but usually on the timescale of seconds, minutes,
   or hours, e.g., when the routes change.

   Presence of certain device on the path:  Could be the presence of a
      certain kind of middlebox, e.g., a proxy, a firewall, a NAT.

   Presence of a specific Autonomous System (AS) on a path:  Indicates
      that traffic goes through a specific AS.

   Disjointness:  How disjoint a path is from another path.

   Path MTU  The end-to-end maximum transmission unit in one packet.

   Transport Protocols available:  Whether a specific transport protocol
      can be used to establish a connection over this path.  An endpoint
      may know this because it has cached whether it could successfully
      establish, e.g., a QUIC connection, or an MPTCP subflow.

   Protocol Features available:  Whether a specific feature within a
      protocol is known to work over this path, e.g., ECN, or TCP Fast
      Open.

   [Idea: Something related to trust level - Does traffic stay within
   the Intranet or not?]

4.  Dynamic Properties

   Dynamic Path Properties are expected to change on the timescale of
   milliseconds.  They usually relate to the state of the path, such as
   the currently available end-to-end bandwidth.  Some of these
   properties may depend only on the first hop or on the access network,
   some may depend on the entire path.

   Typically, Dynamic Properties can only be approximated and sampled,
   and might be made available in an aggregated form, such as averages
   or minimums.  Dynamic Path Properties can be measured by the endpoint
   itself or somethere in the network.  See [ANRW18-Metrics] for a
   discussion of how to measure some dynamic path properties at the
   endpoint.

   These properties may be symmetric or asymmetric.  For example, an
   asymmetric property may be different in the upstream direction and in
   the downstream direction from the point of view of a particular host.

   Available bandwidth:  Maximum number of bytes per second that can be
      sent or received over this path.  This depends on the available
      bandwidth at the bottleneck, and on crosstraffic.

   Round Trip Time:  Time from sending a packet to receiving a response
      from the remote endpoint.

   Round Trip Time variation:  Disparity of Round Trip Time values
      either over time or among multiple concurrent connections.  A high
      RTT variation often indicates congestion.

   Packet Loss:  Percentage of sent packets that are not received on the
      other end.

   Congestion:  Whether there is any indication of congestion on the
      path.

   Wireless Signal strength:  Power level of the wireless signal being
      received.  Lower signal strength, relative to the same noise
      floor, is correlated with higher bit error rates and lower
      modulation rates.

   Wireless Modulation Rate:  Modulation bitrate of the wireless signal.
      The modulation rate determines how many bytes are transmitted
      within a symbol on the wireless channel.  A high modulation rate
      leads to a higher possible bitrate, given sufficient signal
      strength.

   Wireless Channel utilization:  Percentage of time during which there
      is a transmission on the wireless medium.  A high channel
      utilization indicates a congested wireless network.

5.  Technologies to disseminate Path Properties

   [TODO: Is this in scope for this draft?]

   Provisioning Domain:  A consistent set of network configuration
      information as defined in [RFC7556], e.g., relating to a local
      network interface.  This may include source IP address prefixes,
      IP addresses of DNS servers, name of an HTTP proxy server, DNS
      suffixes associated with the network, or default gateway IP
      address.  As one PvD is not restricted to one local network
      interface, a PvD may also apply to multiple paths.

6.  Security Considerations

   Some of these properties may have security implications for
   endpoints.  For example, a corporate policy might require to have a
   firewall on the path.

   If those properties are provided by the network, there is the
   question of whether an endpoint can trust them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
